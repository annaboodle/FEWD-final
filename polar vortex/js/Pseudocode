// PSEUDOCODE

// VARIABLES
lives-remaining = 3;
icicles-dodged = 0;

// MOVEMENT
if left arrow is pressed, 
	move left
if right arrow is pressed, 
	move right

// ICICLES
every X seconds,
	icicle appears at random location at top of gamespace
	icicle moves down with X speed
if icicle reaches bottom of gamespace, 
	disappears
	add 1 to icicles-dodged

// COLLISION
if player touches icicle, 
	icicle disappears
	subtract 1 from lives-remaining

// GAME OVER
if lives-remaining = 0,
	alert that game is over, state number of icicles-dodged
	reset game (reset variables, put player back at starting location)





// POTENTIALLY TO ADD: 
something happens when hit with icicle- player flashes red?
speed up icicle generation over time
some things could fall that are good to "catch" (extra lives)
